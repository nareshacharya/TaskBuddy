# TaskBuddy

TaskBuddy is a simple React-based task management application. It provides basic features to add, complete, and remove tasks.

## Getting Started

No build step is required. Simply open `frontend/index.html` in a browser. The page loads React and Babel from CDNs and runs the app.

## Features

- Add tasks using the input field or by pressing **Enter**.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Remove tasks from the list.

This project is a minimal starting point for a Todoist-like application. Feel free to expand upon it with more advanced features such as due dates, labels, or persistent storage.
